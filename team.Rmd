One analysis to be performed is grouping the ratings by the company that made each chocolate. Then compare companies and their average, mean, ratings. This will show if the company can effect or determine good or bad ratings.

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xdaiISU/ds202materials/master/hwlabs/data/choco.csv") 
means <-  aggregate(choco$Rating, by=list(Company=choco$Company), FUN=mean)
rates <- means$x
names(rates) <- means$Company
top5 <- head(sort(rates, decreasing = TRUE), n= 5)
top5
worst5 <- head(sort(rates, decreasing = FALSE), n= 5)
worst5
```

This shows us the top five and worst five companies and their average ratings for their chocolates.
